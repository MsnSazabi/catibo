# Catibo: read/write/analyze CTB and CBDDLP files

Catibo is a Rust crate for working with the file formats used by low-end resin
3D printers like the Elegoo Mars and CREALITY LD-002R. It provides a low-level
API for manipulating these files and a set of command line tools.

Catibo is the result of reverse engineering of files produced for those
printers, and is not sanctioned or supported by printer manufacturers or the
authors of the proprietary printer control software. To my knowledge, it
contains the first known decoding and implementation of:

- Several newly decoded fields in the files,
- The format of the preview images stored in the files,
- The encryption algorithm used in CTB files.

## `catibo-convert`

The `catibo-convert` tool is included as an example. It can convert between the
`CTB` and `CBDDLP` formats, clear data from reserved areas of files, and add or
remove encryption. It can't currently produce antialiased CBDDLP files from CTB
files, because antialiased CBDDLP is really unnecessarily complex and I ran out
of steam.

Example:

```shell
# Strip encryption
$ cargo run --bin catibo-convert -- --key=0 input.ctb input-decrypted.ctb
# Converting between formats
$ cargo run --bin catibo-convert input.ctb output.cbddlp
```

## `catibo-inspect`

The `catibo-inspect` tool helps reverse engineering by printing parsed headers
from supported file types. If you'd like far too much information about the
contents of a file, but don't want to spend hours squinting at a hexdump, this
tool may be of interest.
